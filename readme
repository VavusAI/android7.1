Vavus Android Translator

This project contains an Android 7.1+ application that lets users authenticate against your vavus service, manage accounts, and submit translation jobs across the full MADLAD language catalog. The app is implemented with Jetpack Compose and targets API level 34 while maintaining compatibility down to Android 7.1 (API 25).

## Features

- **Authentication** – Login and account creation flows that talk directly to your Vavus API. The registration form includes an order number field so you can bind new accounts to provisioning orders.
- **Vavus catalog support** – The translator screen fetches live language metadata from the API and automatically falls back to an embedded ISO-639 snapshot of Vavus-compatible languages when the network is unavailable.
- **Translation workflow** – Pick source and target languages, enter free-form text, and submit translation requests authenticated with the stored bearer token.
- **Session handling** – Securely persists the API base URL, username, and bearer token with DataStore so credentials survive process restarts.
- **Compose-first UI** – Material 3 design, navigation, and responsive layouts tuned for phones and tablets.

## Supabase integration

The project now ships with an optional Supabase client that can be used to log authentication and translation activity to a
PostgREST table. Configuration is driven entirely by environment data so secrets never need to live in version control:

1. Copy `config/runpod/supabase.env.template` to `config/runpod/supabase.env`.
2. Populate the file with your Supabase project URL and anonymous key. You may also supply a service-role key for backend jobs
   running on RunPod. The `.gitignore` entry ensures the populated file is never committed.
3. Provide matching environment variables when building in CI/CD (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
   The Gradle script automatically prefers project properties, then the `config/runpod` file, and finally process environment
   variables.
- **Session handling** – Securely persists the API base URL, email address, and bearer token with DataStore so credentials survive process restarts.   `base_url`, `event_type`, `occurred_at`, and an optional `metadata` JSON column).

If the configuration values are missing the Supabase features are silently disabled and the translator continues to work against
your MADLAD API as before.

## API expectations

The application assumes your MADLAD pod exposes the following endpoints under the base URL entered on the login screen:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/auth/login` | `POST` | Accepts `{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }` and returns `{ "token": "..." }`. |
| `/auth/login` | `POST` | Accepts `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }` and returns `{ "token": "..." }`. |
| `/auth/register` | `POST` | Accepts `{ "email": "...", "password": "...", "orderNumber": "..." }` and may optionally return `{ "token": "..." }` to log the user in immediately. || `/languages` | `GET` | Returns a JSON array of MADLAD-400 language descriptors matching the `MadladLanguage` model (`code`, `name`, optional `script`). |
| `/translate` | `POST` | Accepts `{ "sourceLanguage": "...", "targetLanguage": "...", "text": "..." }` with a bearer token header and responds with `{ "translatedText": "..." }`. |

If any endpoint is unavailable the UI gracefully degrades to the bundled catalog and surfaces meaningful error messages to the user.

## Building

```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Android Studio Hedgehog or later is recommended for development. The project uses the Gradle 8.5 wrapper, Kotlin 1.9, and Jetpack Compose Material 3.

## Running

1. Open the project in Android Studio and let Gradle sync.
2. Update the **API Base URL** field on the login or create-account screen to point at your MAD LAD pod (for example, `https://madlad.example.com/api/`).
